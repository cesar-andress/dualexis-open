# Release notes — v1.0.0

**Title:** TSGG Reference Implementation  
**Repository:** https://github.com/cesar-andress/dualexis-open  
**Tag:** `v1.0.0`  
**Date:** 2026-06-01  
**License:** Apache-2.0

## Purpose

First public archival release of the **Trusted Safety State Governance Graph (TSGG)** reference implementation and validation harness, prepared for *Journal of Systems and Software* (JSS) software-artefact submission and **Zenodo DOI** minting.

## What this release contains

- Python package `dualexis` — trace export, privacy ingress (A1), governance FSM (A4), append-only audit (A5)
- Validation harness CLI — `validate-tsgg`, `leakage-audit`, `formal-governance-audit`
- Reproduction scripts — `artifact/commands.sh`, `artifact/REPRODUCE.md`, `artifact/expected_outputs.md`
- Manuscript build chain — `paper/main_jss.tex`, `scripts/build_jss_submission.py`
- Submission package generator — `dist/jss_submission_package/`

## TSGG trace chain

```
Evidence → Safety State → Causal Transition → Recommendation → Governance Decision → Audit Trace
```

Supported capabilities:

- privacy admissibility constraints (fail-closed ingress, fuzz regression)
- governance-aware decision traces (FSM macro-states, audit append-only semantics)
- benchmark leakage auditing (procedural / distributional independence metrics)
- reproducible validation harnesses (scripted table regeneration, unit tests)

## Reproduce validation results

```bash
pip install -e .
bash artifact/commands.sh
```

Expected outputs are documented in `artifact/expected_outputs.md`.

Build the JSS manuscript PDF:

```bash
python3.12 scripts/build_jss_submission.py --latex-only
```

## Citation

## Zenodo archival checklist

1. Connect GitHub repository to Zenodo (or upload release archive manually).
2. Create GitHub release **`v1.0.0`** from this tag; Zenodo ingests `.zenodo.json` metadata.
3. Publish Zenodo record; copy minted DOI into:
   - `CITATION.cff` (`identifiers` → `doi`)
   - `artifact/CITATION.cff`
   - `paper/data_availability_statement.txt`
   - JSS submission metadata
4. Add Zenodo badge to `README.md` after DOI assignment (optional).

## Known scope limits

- Simulation-based software validation only; no field-deployment or user-study claims
- Synthetic scenarios bundled; no external datasets required
- JSS paper DOI to be linked after acceptance/publication

## Authors

- David Martín Moncunill — Conceptualization, Methodology, Software, Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing
- César Andrés Sánchez — Conceptualization, Methodology, Validation, Investigation, Supervision, Writing
